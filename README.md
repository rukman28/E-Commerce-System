## Features

### Search By Image

#### Client-Side (JavaScript):

1. **User Input:** The user selects an image file from their device using an HTML file input element.
2. **Image Processing:** JavaScript reads the image file and converts it into a Base64 encoded string, which is a text format suitable for sending through an HTTP request.
3. **AJAX Request:** The JavaScript code sends an AJAX request to the server endpoint `/search-by-image/`, carrying the Base64 encoded image data in the request body.

#### Server-Side (Django):

1. **Receive Image Data:** The Django view function receives the AJAX request containing the Base64 encoded image data.
2. **Process Image:** The image is processed using a model hosted on the Replicate computing platform, which extracts a caption from the image using machine learning.
3. **Search for Similar Products:** The extracted text data is used to search for visually similar products in the database.
4. **Return Search Results:** The view function sends a JSON response with details of the matching products, including titles, prices, and potentially image URLs.

#### Client-Side (Response Handling):

1. **Receive Response:** The JavaScript code receives the JSON response from the server.
2. **Parse Results:** The response data is parsed to extract information about the matching products.
3. **Display Results:** The JavaScript dynamically generates HTML content to display the retrieved products, creating product cards with titles, images, and prices. If no matching products are found, an appropriate message is displayed.

#### Benefits:

- **Simplified Product Search:** Users can find similar products without manually entering text descriptions.
- **Improved User Experience:** Provides a more intuitive way to search for visual items.
- **Accessibility:** Helps users who have difficulty describing products in words.

### Product Description Generation Using AI

#### Admin-Side (Django Admin Interface):

1. **Add Product:** When an admin adds a new product, they upload an image of the product along with other necessary details like the title and price.
2. **Generate Caption:** Upon saving the product, the application automatically calls a machine learning model to generate a caption from the product image.
3. **Generate Description:** The generated caption is then passed to the Langchain and Gemini Large Language Models (LLMs) to create a customer-centric product description.
4. **Save Description:** The generated product description is saved in the database, providing a rich and engaging product description for potential customers.

#### Benefits:

- **Enhanced Product Descriptions:** Automatically generates detailed and attractive product descriptions to improve customer engagement.
- **Time Efficiency:** Saves time for admins by automating the product description creation process.
- **Consistency:** Ensures consistent and high-quality product descriptions across the online store.
